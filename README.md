# INTRO
Completing this test assignment provided me with valuable hands-on experience in several key areas. I further enhanced my skills in responsive web design, particularly in creating adaptable layouts for different screen sizes. I gained practical knowledge of working with REST APIs, including handling GET and POST requests and integrating API responses into the application. Additionally, I improved my understanding of form validation and submission, error handling, and managing state using Redux. The project allowed me to familiarize myself with a range of technologies, libraries, and tools, enabling me to develop efficient and robust front-end solutions.

# TECHNOLOGIES:

To complete this project, I utilized the following technologies:

## React
I used React, a JavaScript library, to build the user interface and manage component-based architecture efficiently.

## React Hooks
React Hooks: React Hooks, including useState, useEffect, useSelector, useDispatch, useAppDispatch, and useAppSelector, were used to add state and other React features to functional components. I used these hooks to manage component state, handle side effects, and access Redux store data.

## Redux
I used to handle the application's global state. It allowed me to manage data flow and make it easily accessible across components, ensuring a consistent and predictable user experience.

## TypeScript
I used TypeScript to define types and interfaces for REST API data, action types in Redux, and enums for error handling. This helped prevent runtime errors and improved code robustness.

## JavaScript
JavaScript: I utilized JavaScript to handle various functionalities, such as making async functions, using try-catch constructions for error handling, and performing GET and POST requests.

## SCSS
SCSS: It improves code maintainability and provides a more organized and efficient way of writing styles.

## Git and GitHub
Git and GitHub: I used Git and GitHub to track and manage changes in the project, and host the project.

## Media Queries
Media Queries: Media queries are CSS features used to apply different styles based on the device's screen size or other media features. I utilized media queries to create a responsive design that adapts to four different screen sizes, ensuring optimal user experience across devices.

## React Loading Library
React Loading Library: I used the React Loading library to display loading indicators during API requests or form submissions. This improves user experience by providing visual feedback on ongoing processes.

## Classnames Library
Classnames: I utilized classnames to manage dynamic class assignments based on specific conditions, enhancing the flexibility and readability of the code.

## npm
npm: It allowed me to manage project dependencies and install various libraries and tools needed for the project.

## Prettier and ESLint
Prettier and ESLint: They help maintain consistent coding styles, catch potential errors, and improve code quality and readability.

## LocalStorage
LocalStorage: LocalStorage was utilized in the project to store the token required for accessing the REST API. 

## Vite
Vite: The project was built using the Vite framework, which served as the template for development. Vite is a modern build tool that offers a fast and efficient development experience for JavaScript-based applications.

## BEM
BEM (Block-Element-Modifier): was employed in the project for writing CSS styles. BEM is a popular naming convention and methodology that helps organize and structure CSS code in a modular and maintainable way.

## Clean and Organized Code
Clean and Organized Code: The project followed a coding style that emphasized clean and well-organized code with proper indentation and consistent formatting. The code was structured in a logical and readable manner, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain. In addition to clean code practices, the CSS styles in the project followed a chronological order, with position-related styles defined first. This approach ensured that the positioning of elements was clearly defined before any other styles were applied. The project also employed naming conventions for variables, functions, and CSS classes. Consistent naming conventions helped in understanding the purpose and functionality of different code components. It promoted self-documenting code, reducing the need for excessive comments and making the codebase more comprehensible.

## Explanation Comments
Explanation Comments: The project incorporated explanation comments throughout the codebase to provide clarity and context for the implemented functionalities, complex logic, or any non-obvious code sections.
